      <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This Cancellation & Refund Policy (“Policy”) applies to purchases made via <code>metadev.in</code> and our products — <strong>MetaHealth, MetaEdu, MetaGreen, MetaFlow, MetaHire, MetaCheck, MetaAds, MetaNav, MetaLedger, MetaCard, MetaIM, MetaPE</strong> — and to custom design / engineering services contracted under a Statement of Work (SoW) or order form.</p>
      <p>It supplements our <a href="/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> and product-specific order forms. Where there is a conflict, the <strong>order form / SOW prevails</strong>, then this Policy, then the site Terms.</p>
      <p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> any customer who pays MetaDev directly — self-serve SaaS subscriptions and invoiced enterprise agreements. If you purchased via a marketplace or reseller, their cancellation terms also apply — contact them and us via <a href="mailto:support@metadev.in">support@metadev.in</a> so we can coordinate.</p>

      <p>Free trials, betas, and freemium tiers have no charge to cancel — just stop use or delete the workspace before the trial converts.</p>

      <h2 id="subscriptions">3. Subscription cancellation</h2>
      <p><strong>Cancel anytime.</strong> You may cancel a renewing subscription at any time and retain access through the end of the current billing period. There is no cancellation fee.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-serve:</strong> Dashboard → Billing → Manage plan → Cancel (requires Owner / Billing Admin). You receive an email confirmation immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>By email:</strong> Write to <a href="mailto:support@metadev.in">support@metadev.in</a> from your registered billing email with subject “Cancellation — [Product] — [Workspace/Org name]”. We confirm within <strong>1 business day</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Effective date:</strong> Cancellation stops the <em>next</em> renewal. The current paid period runs to its end; no pro-rata refund for partial use unless §5 applies.</li>
        <li><strong>Notice for invoiced/enterprise:</strong> Cancel with at least <strong>30 days’ written notice</strong> before renewal, or as stated in your order form (some multi-year deals require 60–90 days).</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-renewal reminder:</strong> For non-enterprise renewals we send a reminder at least <strong>7 days</strong> before charging the next period.</li>
      </ul>

          <p className="m-0 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-500">Cancel at least <strong>24 hours before renewal</strong> for card-billed self-serve plans. Email requests are timestamped on receipt; we honour the time received, not the time processed.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>48-hour window:</strong> If you cancel within <strong>48 hours after a renewal charge</strong> and have not used the new period (no logins, no API calls, no new records), write to <a href="mailto:support@metadev.in">support@metadev.in</a> — we will refund the renewal in full as a one-time courtesy per account.</p>
      <p><strong>Downgrades vs cancellation:</strong> Reducing seats or switching to a lower plan takes effect at the next renewal; the current period stays at the higher tier with no mid-cycle refund.</p>

      <h2 id="services">4. Professional services & SOW</h2>
      <p>Custom services are scheduled and staffed on commitment. Cancellation and rescheduling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may terminate a SOW for convenience with written notice as stated in the SOW (default: <strong>15 days</strong>). Fees for work performed, milestones accepted, and non-cancellable third-party costs incurred up to the effective date remain payable.</li>
        <li>Prepaid retainers / deposits are applied to delivered work. Unapplied retainer for undelivered, un-started phases is refundable within <strong>10 business days</strong> of termination, less any cancellation window costs in the SOW.</li>
        <li>On termination we deliver all completed, paid-for deliverables and a handover pack within <strong>10 business days</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Milestone acceptance delays do not extend payment terms unless mutually agreed in writing.</p>

        <li>Refunds go to the <strong>original payment method</strong>. If that is not possible (e.g., closed account), we issue via bank transfer after verification.</li>
        <li>GST / taxes already remitted to authorities are refunded only where we can lawfully reclaim them; otherwise a credit note is issued.</li>
        <li>Currency: refunds are in <strong>INR</strong> unless the order form states another currency. FX differences are borne per the payment provider’s rate.</li>

        <li>Fees for a billing period already started and used (logins, API calls, records created) are non-refundable.</li>
        <li>Consumption-based charges — per-verification (MetaCheck), per-message, ad spend, SMS/WhatsApp, KYC / bureau fees, card-issuance, and other pass-through third-party fees — once successfully processed.</li>

      <h2 id="effect">7. What happens after cancellation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You retain full access until the end of the paid period (subscriptions) or until the SOW termination date (services). After that, the workspace moves to a read-only grace period of <strong>7 days</strong> (subscriptions) so you can export data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data & export:</strong> Export via Dashboard or request an export from <a href="mailto:support@metadev.in">support@metadev.in</a> during the grace period. Afterward, data is retained per your DPA / our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and then deleted or anonymised. Deletion of personal data on written request per DPDP Act is available at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Reactivation:</strong> You may reactivate within <strong>30 days</strong> without data loss in most cases; beyond that, restoration is on a best-effort basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party services:</strong> Domain, SMS sender-ID, payment-gateway, or bureau connections that you authorised remain yours to disconnect; we revoke our app-level access on termination.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-to">8. How to request cancellation or a refund</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>From your account (fastest):</strong> Billing owner → Dashboard → Billing → “Cancel / Manage plan”. For refunds, use “Report a billing issue” on the same page.</li>
        <li><strong>By email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@metadev.in">support@metadev.in</a> with subject <code>Cancellation — [Product] — [Org]</code> or <code>Refund — [Invoice ID]</code>. Include org/workspace name, product, invoice/transaction ID, and reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Business / enterprise:</strong> Also CC <a href="mailto:business@metadev.in">business@metadev.in</a> or your account manager for faster routing.</li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> We acknowledge within <strong>1 business day</strong> and give a decision within <strong>5 business days</strong> (sooner for duplicate-charge cases).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We may ask for verification (e.g., confirmation from the billing email) to prevent unauthorised cancellations. Once approved, refunds are processed in <strong>7–10 business days</strong>; your bank may take an additional 3–7 days to post.</p>
      <p>Not satisfied? Escalate to <a href="mailto:info@metadev.in">info@metadev.in</a> (Grievance Officer, IT Rules, 15-day redressal) or raise a ticket via <a href="/contact">Contact</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="rights">9. Consumer rights & exceptions</h2>
      <p>Nothing in this Policy limits rights you have under the <strong>Consumer Protection Act, 2019</strong>, the <strong>Indian Contract Act, 1872</strong>, or other applicable law — including rights relating to deficient services or unfair contracts. Where law grants a cooling-off or withdrawal right, we honour it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we materially increase renewal pricing, we notify at least <strong>30 days</strong> in advance; you may cancel before the new price takes effect and retain the old price through the current period.</li>
        <li>If we discontinue a product or feature you prepaid for, we refund the unused prepaid portion on a pro-rata basis.</li>
        <li>Fraud, chargeback abuse, or use in breach of our <a href="/legal/terms-of-service">Terms</a> may result in suspension and forfeiture of any promotional credits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="changes">10. Changes & contact</h2>
      <p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in products, pricing, or law. Material changes are posted here with a new “Last updated” date; for paid customers we also provide email notice at least <strong>15 days</strong> before they take effect. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance; if you disagree, cancel before renewal.</p>
