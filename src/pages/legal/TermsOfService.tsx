      <h2 id="ip">6. Intellectual property & feedback</h2>
      <p>The site, designs, code, trademarks “MetaDev” and product marks, and documentation are owned by MetaDev or its licensors and protected by Indian and international IP law. No rights are granted except as expressly stated.</p>
      <p>Customer deliverables are licensed or assigned as set out in the applicable SoW. Pre-existing IP, tools, and reusable components remain ours, licensed to you for the project purpose. If you send feedback or ideas, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual licence to use them without obligation.</p>

      <h2 id="fees">7. Fees, taxes & payment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Paid products and services are billed as per the order form / SoW. Fees are exclusive of GST and other applicable taxes, which you bear.</li>
        <li>Invoices are payable within the stated term; late amounts may incur interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum lawful rate.</li>
        <li>Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled per the product terms. See our <a href="/legal/cancellation">Cancellation & Refund Policy</a> for notice periods and refunds.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="privacy">8. Privacy & data protection</h2>
      <p>How we handle personal data is described in our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and, for products, in the relevant Data Processing Agreement. Where you provide personal data of others (e.g., candidates via MetaHire, payees via MetaLedger), you warrant you have a lawful basis and required notices/consents.</p>

      <h2 id="warranties">9. Warranties & disclaimer</h2>
      <p>We perform services with professional skill and care consistent with industry standards. Except as expressly warranted in a signed contract, services are provided <strong>“as is” and “as available”</strong>. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation; beta or labs features may change or be withdrawn.</p>

        <span className="flex h-9 w-9 shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-amber-100 text-amber-600"><AlertTriangle size={18} /></span>
        <div>
          <p className="mb-1 text-sm font-bold text-meta-navy">No legal / regulated advice</p>
          <p className="m-0 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-500">Content on the site is general information, not legal, financial, medical, or compliance advice. For regulated use-cases (e.g., health records, financial reporting, background verification), obtain independent professional advice and follow applicable law.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 id="liability">10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law: (a) neither party is liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill; (b) our aggregate liability arising from the site or services is capped at the amount you paid to MetaDev in the <strong>3 months</strong> preceding the claim (or ₹50,000 if no paid services). These limits do not apply to liability that cannot be limited by law (e.g., fraud, wilful misconduct, or where prohibited).</p>

      <h2 id="suspension">11. Suspension & termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate access where needed to comply with law, protect security, prevent abuse, or where you materially breach these Terms and fail to cure within 15 days of notice. You may stop using the site at any time; subscriptions terminate per their terms and our <a href="/legal/cancellation">Cancellation Policy</a>. Sections that should survive (IP, fees, liability, governing law) do.</p>

      <h2 id="law">12. Governing law & disputes</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the <strong>laws of India</strong>. Courts at <strong>Hyderabad, Telangana</strong> have exclusive jurisdiction. Before litigation, parties will attempt good-faith negotiation for 30 days, then mediation under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (seat: Hyderabad, language: English) if agreed in the contract; otherwise the courts decide. Nothing limits urgent injunctive relief.</p>

      <h2 id="changes">13. Changes & contact</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms to reflect legal, technical, or business changes. Material changes will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date; for registered users we may also email. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>
